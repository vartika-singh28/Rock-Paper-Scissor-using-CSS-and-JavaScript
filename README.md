# Rock-Paper-Scissor

## Description:Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors". This JavasScript [Mini Project] is aimed at automating one of the player called as Computerized Player and  taking rock, paper or scissor as an input from the used.

## How to Play
* Partners say, “Rock Paper Scissors” together with their hands in a fist.
* On “paper,” players pick one of three things to show with their hand:
* Rock which is demonstrated by a fist.
* Scissors with two finger spread out to represent scissors. (This looks like a sideways peace sign.)
* Paper by holding out a palm down, flat hand.
* If players show the same things, they go again.
* If one player picks rock and one scissors, the player who showed rock wins the dispute. To explain this, say rock crushes scissors (no need to actually crush).
* If one player picks scissors and the other paper, the player who showed scissors succeeds. Scissors cuts paper.
* If a player shows paper while the other shows rock, the player who picked paper succeeds. Paper covers rock.
Once game is taught, ask players to use in many different games and situations to solve minor disputes, such as is the ball in or out or who arrived first in line.

## Rules
A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
